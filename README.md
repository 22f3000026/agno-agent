## üîí Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: API key for Tavily search/crawl functionality
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: API key for ElevenLabs text-to-speech
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI (DALL-E 3 image generation)

## üé® Storyboard Types

The system supports four types of storyboards:

1. **Educational**: Informative content with clear explanations and learning objectives
2. **Marketing**: Promotional content with compelling visuals and messaging
3. **Entertainment**: Engaging storytelling with dramatic or humorous elements
4. **Technical**: Detailed technical content with diagrams and specifications

## üìê Aspect Ratios

Storyboards are automatically generated in **1:1 square format** (1024x1024) to ensure:
- Consistent visual presentation across all scenes
- Uniform layout and composition
- Better visual flow and narrative coherence
- No need to specify aspect ratio - it's handled automatically

## üé® Art Style Consistency

Each storyboard type uses a consistent art style across all scenes. You can also provide your own custom style.

- **Educational**: Clean, professional illustration style with bright colors and clear composition
- **Marketing**: Modern, vibrant commercial art style with high contrast and engaging visuals  
- **Entertainment**: Dynamic, cinematic style with dramatic lighting and rich colors
- **Technical**: Precise, technical illustration style with neutral colors and detailed diagrams

This ensures visual continuity and creates a cohesive storyboard experience.

## üöÄ Testing

Run the test script to try the storyboard generation:

```bash
python test_storyboard.py
```

This will generate a sample storyboard about the solar system with 3 educational scenes in 1:1 square format with consistent art style.
